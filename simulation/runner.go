// TODO NEXT STEPS
//
// 1. Create method #runSimulation(numberOfMonths)
// 2. For every month, take every borrower, and check if it should fail && this month?
// 3a. For those who fail, implement the failure (balance == 0 + log).
// 3b. For those who don't fail, create the transaction borrower => lender + log
// 4. Print a simulation summary including:
// 		- Total loans at the beginning vs total loans at the end (diff = failures)
// 		- Total money in the economy at the beginning vs at the end
//
// - Bind "borrowers", "insurers", "lenders", "loans" and "transactions" to tabs to see ouput of simulation
